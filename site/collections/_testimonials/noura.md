blurb: >-
  Kevin is an absolute pleasure to work with, he joined Mejuri for a summer internship to assist with software development projects in 2013. He is a passionate employee and has a great appetite for learning and for enhancing his skills. He definitely demonstrated strong communication skills and was always open to feedback. I would highly recommend Kevin.
