blurb: >-
  Starting my very first software developer job was scary! Starting it remote, during a pandemic - even scarier. Thanks to Kevin, these things were way less intimidating! Kevin is incredibly personable, and immediately made me feel like part of the team even though I had never met any of my team members in person.
