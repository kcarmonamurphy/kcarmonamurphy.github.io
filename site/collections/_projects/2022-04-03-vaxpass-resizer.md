This project was created with the intention of allowing for the resizing of Enhanced Vaccination Certificates issued by provincial governments in Canada.

It takes in a pdf file and outputs a new file with two sizes: one that is wallet sized, and the other fits inside a passport sleeve.

It was written in vanilla JS, using PDFLib.
