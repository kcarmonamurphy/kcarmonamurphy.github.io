**Created:** December 2021

### Description

This is a utility that allows a user to upload a PDF of their vaccine passport and shrinks it down to passport and credit card sized dimensions.

The resulting outputted PDF contains the shrunken versions along with rulers on the edges to verify proper sizing and also to indicate where to cut and fold so that they can fit snugly within a passport cover or in the credit card slot of a wallet.

### Context

In October of 2021, the Canadian Government rolled out the standardized Enhanced Vaccine Passport which became an important document for anyone wishing to travel abroad during the Covid-19 Pandemic.
