**Created:** May 2015

`multi-translator-angular` is a simple Angular.js (v1) app which can translate an English word or phrase into multiple languages, simultaneously. It relies on the LibreTranslate translation engine to provide these translations.

N.B: Formerly, this project used the Yandex Translation API which resulted in better translations, however, due to the ongoing Ukrainian-Russian conflict I have opted to withdraw usage of the Yandex API.
